All of my relevant dotfiles. Idea being that on any new system I can just pull these off of github and be up and running quickly. They're also here in case anyone is interested.

Since git will not allow you to clone into an existing directory, I check this out into ~/dotfiles with:

`git clone git@github.com:victorquinn/dotfiles.git`

Then run the movefiles script to copy all dotfiles/directories into my home directory. Run:

`sudo ~/dotfiles/movefiles.sh`
