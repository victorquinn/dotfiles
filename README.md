Victor Quinn's Dotfiles
=======================

My relevant dotfiles. Idea being that on any new system I can just pull these off of github and be up and running quickly. Public repo in case anyone is interested.

These are now managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/)

So it should be as easy as dropping on a new machine, installing yadm then running `yadm clone git@github.com:victorquinn/dotfiles`
