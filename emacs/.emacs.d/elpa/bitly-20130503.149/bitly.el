;;; Commentary:

;; Simple mode to shorten URLs from Emacs.

;; Use (bitly-shorten URL) from an Emacs Lisp program, or
;; M-x bitly-url-at-point to replace the URL at point (or the region)
;; with a shortened version.

;; To use, go to https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps to generate your personal
;; API access token. Then customize `bitly-access-token' and set it to
;; the token you just got.

;;; Code:

(require 'thingatpt)

(defgroup bitly nil
  "The bitly URL shortening service."
  :prefix "bitly-"
  :group 'applications)

(defcustom bitly-access-token nil
  "The OAuth access token for bitly.

Get your personal token here: https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps"
  :type 'string
  :group 'bitly)

(defvar bitly-base-url "https://api-ssl.bitly.com")

  "Return a shortened URL for LONG-URL."

                      (url-hexify-string long-url)))
         (json-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously url))
         (response (with-current-buffer json-buffer
                     (goto-char (point-min))
