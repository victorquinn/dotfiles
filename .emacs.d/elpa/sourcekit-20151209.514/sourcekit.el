;;; Commentary:

;; sourcekit.el is a library that interacts with sourcekittendaemon in order
;; to communicate with SourceKit. Given a Xcode project in the directory tree,
;; It provides functions to spin up/down daemons, discover existing daemons,
;; and send queries to them either synchronous or asynchronously.
