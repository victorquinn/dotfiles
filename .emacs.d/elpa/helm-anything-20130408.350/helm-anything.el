;; * M-x `helm-anything-resume' replaces M-x `anything-resume' and M-x `helm-resume'.
;; 
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put helm-anything.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'helm-anything)
;; ;; Replace helm-resume and anything-resume with helm-anything-resume
;; (helm-anything-set-keys)
;;
;; No need more.
