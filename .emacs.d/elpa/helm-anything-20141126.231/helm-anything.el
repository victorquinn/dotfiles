;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Bridge between anything and helm.
;;
;; M-x `helm-anything-resume' replaces M-x `anything-resume' and M-x
;; `helm-resume'.
;;
;; `helm-anything/funcall', `helm-anything/set' and
;; `helm-anything/get' handles helm or anything functions and
;; variables.
;;
;; `helm-anything/define-key' binds key to `helm-map' and `anything-map'.
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put helm-anything.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'helm-anything)
;; ;; Replace helm-resume and anything-resume with helm-anything-resume
;; (helm-anything-set-keys)
;;
;; No need more.
;;
;;; Examples:
;;
;; (defun helm-anything-occur-search-forward ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (helm-anything/funcall 'next-line) ;; or (anything-previous-line)
;;   (helm-anything/funcall 'execute-persistent-action))
;;
;; (setq helm-testvar 0)
;; (setq anything-testvar 100)
;; (defun helm-anything-test ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (helm-anything/set 'testvar (1+ (helm-anything/value 'testvar)))
;;   (message "%s" (helm-anything/value 'testvar)))
;; (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-x C-z") 'helm-anything-test)
;; (define-key anything-map (kbd "C-x C-z") 'helm-anything-test)
